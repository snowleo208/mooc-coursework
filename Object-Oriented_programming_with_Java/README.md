## How to run Java file?

If you are interested in my solutions, use `git clone` to get a copy to your local environment and run these commands.

Compile the Java File to a `.class` file

```java
javac *.java
```

This will create a `<FILENAME>.class` file.

Run the Java file (without extension, i.e. `.java`):

```java
java <FILENAME>
```
