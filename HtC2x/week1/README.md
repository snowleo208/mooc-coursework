# Mutual Reference Module

In this module, we'll learn how to use multiple mutually referential types to structure more complex arbitrary-sized data. We update the HtDD and HtDF recipes for this purpose, but most of the work you already know how to do.

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take approximately 6-7 hours of dedicated time to complete.

# Learning Goals

- Be able to identify problem domain information of arbitrary size that should be represented using arbitrary arity trees.
- Be able to use the design recipes to design with arbitrary arity trees.
- Be able to use the design recipes with mutually-referential data.
- Be able to predict and identify the correspondence between external-, self- and mutual-reference in a data definition and calls, recursion and mutual-recursion in functions that operate on the data.

## Notes

When dealing with type involving mutual reference, group type comments + interpretations, examples and templates, it is better to put all the templates together. Easier to see all while designing functions.
