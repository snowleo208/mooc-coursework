# How to Design Functions

This module is where this course starts to differ from other introductory programming coursesâ€”we are going to start learning the design method, and this should be new material even for people who have programmed before.


## Learning Goals

- Be able to use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design functions that operate on primitive data.
- Be able to read a complete function design and identify its different elements.
- Be able to evaluate the different elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency with each other.
- Be able to evaluate the entire design for how well it solves the given problem.


### How To Design Functions (HtDF)

- Signature, purpose and stub.
- Define examples, wrap each in check-expect.
- Template and inventory.
- Code the function body.
- Test and debug until correct

#### Notes

- not waterfall process, i.e. can change later, like signature or template can change while developing
- need to write purpose clearly, like defining what is tall means, e.g. tall means (height > width)
- should have complete code coverage, no unexecuted code inside func
- tests should think of boundary cases
