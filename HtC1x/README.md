# How to Code: Simple Data

Welcome to How to Code: Simple Data - the first course in the UBCx Software Development MicroMasters. In this course you will begin to learn how experts read and write programs in terms of higher level design structures. You will learn a systematic program design method and use it to write programs of increasing complexity. Thanks for signing up, we hope that you will enjoy the course and find it rewarding!

This course is using Beginning Student Language (BSL) and you can open it via DrRacket.

My environment is Windows 10 and DrRacket version 7.2.
