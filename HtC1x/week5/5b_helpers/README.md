# Week 5b: helpers

In this module, we learn several new rules for breaking design problems into pieces, learning several rules for breaking a function down into multiple functions.

## Learning Goals

Be able to design functions that use helper functions for each of the following reasons:

- at references to other non-primitive data definitions (this will be in the template)
- to form a function composition
- to handle a knowledge domain shift
- to operate on arbitrary sized data

## Notes

When we shift knowledge domain, we should use a helper function, e.g. sorting a list and comparing image size are different domain, so we need one more helper function.
