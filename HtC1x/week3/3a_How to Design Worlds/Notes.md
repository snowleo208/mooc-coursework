# How to design worlds

## Domain analysis

- work on the paper first
- get all requirements and write constants (variables) and requirements clearly
- domain analysis is the model of the program
- correctly describes the structure of the program, but it has less details, we can plan our work on the program by marking up the analysis
- thus we can change or add requirements easily

## Large enumerations

- for normal enumerations, we need to do all test cases
- for large enumerations, we only need to do white-box testing, create tests based on knowledge of how the function is coded, not what it is supposed to do
  > no need to create all test cases
