# Week 3: How to Design Worlds

In this module you will learn how to design interactive programs that use the DrRacket big-bang functionality. We will make simple animations of animals walking across the screen that can be controlled by the keyboard and the mouse. In learning this process we also cover basic techniques for systematizing your work on larger programs. This module is complemented by the Compound module, which allows us to create more complex data definitions, that in turn support more complex world programs.

## Learning Goals

- Be able to explain the inherent structure of interactive graphical programs.
- Be able to use the How to Design Worlds (HtDW) recipe to design interactive programs with atomic world state.
- Be able to read and write big-bang expressions.
