# Week 4b: Reference

This module's programs are once again much shorter than those from HtDW and Compound.

The videos this module range in length. But there isn't a half hour one! As before, the longer ones are mostly just a step-by-step working through of a problem, so while it takes time to watch, it isn't all new content.

In this module we take a small but very significant step in terms of the complexity of the information we can represent as data. We will start to have designs with more than one data definition each for representing one part of the overall information. As we have seen before this difference will arise in the information, be reflected in the type comments, be carried into the templates by the template rules and show up in the structure of the final function definitions and tests.

## Learning Goal

- Be able to predict and identify the correspondence between references in a data definition and helper function calls in functions that operate on the data.

### Notes

Reasons of doing examples before function

- figure out what we want the function to do
- remember the names of primitives we need
- get the details like the order of arguments right

With the example before the function, we can figure out all the above out in specific cases, rather than the general purposes behaviour of the function (that's easier). Recipe make us to do easiest task next, chipping away the overall function design problem, making what's left easier and easier.
